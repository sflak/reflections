When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  By using a remote repository, other contributors can view and modify your code.
  This can help when working collaboratively. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's possible that you are working on a different solution to the same
    problem, so it would be frustrating if your local files automatically 
    updated with the remote ones.
