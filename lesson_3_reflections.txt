When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  By using a remote repository, other contributors can view and modify your code.
  This can help when working collaboratively. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's possible that you are working on a different solution to the same
    problem, so it would be frustrating if your local files automatically 
    updated with the remote ones. 
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are essentially the same as clones, except they are done exclusively
    on git hub, and git hib keeps track of forks so that people get credit for 
    their work. Clones are copies of git repositories that you store on your
    local computer. Branches are when you create a new line of commits that you
    can then merge later with other branches. If you wanted to publicly share
    your changes to someone else's git hub repository, then that is when you 
    should use a Fork instead of just a clone. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This way, any conflicts that arise from merging can be resolved.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

master?  What benefits does each approach have?
